The infrastructure design has the following components
a. Server
b. Web server - Nginx
c. Application server
d. Database

Explanation of the Design flow:
1. A user types the website domain on their laptop/computer browser i.e www.foobar.com
2. The browser sends the url to the DNS server for IP resolution.
3. The DNS responds with the corresponding IP address i.e 8.8.8.8
4. The browser sends the request to render the website page to IP 8.8.8.8 which is the server IP. A server hosts contents that can be accessed by client computers.
5. The server routes the request to the web server via a specific port number i.e 80. A web server hosts and surves static web content to clients.
6. The web server will make a request to the application server to load and process the application logic and respond to the web server with the result. An application server hosts application with dynamic contents and logics
7. The application server will make SQL query processing request to the database.
8. The database will execute the query and respond to the application with the result.
